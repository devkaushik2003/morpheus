## Briefly write about the project that you have submitted from the perspective of the user.

From a user's perspective, the platform offers an intuitive interface to design custom forms with various question types, such as multiple-choice, text input, and checkboxes. Users can easily distribute these forms via a unique link and view the responses in a consolidated format. The back-end ensures data is securely stored and easily retrievable for analysis.

## Assumptions you have made for this project?

User Authentication: Users must create an account and log in to create and manage forms, ensuring secure access to their data.

Form Structure: The application supports basic question types, such as multiple-choice, text input, and checkboxes. Advanced features like file uploads or conditional logic are not included in this version.

Backend and Database Setup: A relational database ( SQLite) is used to store user and form data, assuming the server setup supports Djangoâ€™s requirements.

## Other information (like testing credentials)

There is no need for pre-set credentials. Users can register using their email address and set up a password to log in and access the platform.

## Did you learn anything new while doing this assignment? Please explain.

Through the Google Form Clone project, I significantly enhanced my backend development skills, particularly in using Django for managing models, views, and URL routing, as well as securely handling form data and user authentication.

## How much time did it take for you complete the project?

About One Day

## If you had more time, what enhancements will you make?

If I had more time, I would enhance the Google Form Clone by adding advanced features like conditional logic, file uploads, and media integration to make forms more versatile. Custom themes and better mobile responsiveness would improve the user experience, while a detailed analytics dashboard and export options in formats like CSV or PDF would make data analysis more efficient. Collaboration tools for shared editing, real-time notifications for new responses, and improved security measures such as CAPTCHA and two-factor authentication would further elevate the platform.
